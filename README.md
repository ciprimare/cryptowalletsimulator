# CryptoCurrency Wallet Simulator API 

## Problem
The simulator design will be a simple POC, it will allow CRUD operations of the wallets, and allow for the transfer operations in, and between wallets.

## How I did it
1. Create a REST API using Spring Boot
2. Create a unit test to automatically test rest controller
3. Create sample methods in api to demonstrate: CRUD operations for wallet
5. No persistence implemented
6. API documentation using Swagger

## How to test it

1. [Source code](https://github.com/ciprimare/cryptowalletsimulator)
2. [API documentation](https://cryptowalletsimulator.herokuapp.com/swagger-ui.html)
